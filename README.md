# amber-io

Inspired by Resin but with the purpose of pushing to a Raspberry Pi, or similar device, which is on-line and Piggy-backed onto non-internet-connected device via local connection (serial/usb).  Allowing us to deliver embedded code via local connection.  Then returning logs and status of deployment to the Amber-io master.
